A local copy of an older version of the VRPLIB reader from https://github.com/leonlan/VRPLIB
that can no longer be installed via pip. The new version has a different
interface and is not backward compatible.

This copy is from version cvrplib==0.1.1, which is a dependency for
the decomposition experiments that read CVRPLIB instances.
